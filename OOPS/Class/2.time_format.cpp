// Create a class called time that has separate int member data for hours, minutes and
// seconds. One constructor should initialize this data to 0, and another should
// initialize it to fixed values. Another member function should display it, in 11:59:59
// format. The final member function should add two objects of type time passed as
// arguments. And also use operator overloading concept to show add operation.
// A main () program should create two initialized time objects, and one that isnâ€™t
// initialized. Then it should add the two initialized values together, leaving the result
// in the third time variable. Finally it should display the value of the third variable.
